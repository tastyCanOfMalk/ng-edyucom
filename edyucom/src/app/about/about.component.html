        As a chemist, I enjoyed the automation of our,
        admittedly, outdated data methods more than the actual chemistry itself.
        When you have to process heaps of raw data and present it in a
        meaningful way, it pays to be lazy and streamline the process!
        <br />
        <br />
        The presentation of said analyses were also something I took a shining
        to, ultimately steering me to pursue a Masters of Data Analytics at
        Georgia Tech. You'll find some projects here using skills I've picked up
        along the way.
